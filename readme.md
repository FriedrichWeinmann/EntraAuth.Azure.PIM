# EntraAuth.Azure.PIM

An early stages dev Version that is not yet functional.
This module will later be able to manage the configuration of Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Azure Resources.

For now, you can find a POC implementation under the POC folder, that still uses `Az.Accounts` rather than EntraAuth.
